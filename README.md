Mobile App Portfolio Reflection

App Summary and User Needs
The mobile app I developed is an Event Tracking App that allows users to create, view, and manage events in an organized way. The goal was to make it easy for users to log details about upcoming events such as name, date, time, and description, while being able to review them at a glance. The app was designed to help users stay organized and avoid missing important activities or deadlines.
UI Design and Features
The main screen displays a grid of existing events, making it simple for users to browse and select an event. From there, users can add new events using the Add Event button, which opens a form to enter details. The interface is clean, minimal, and uses logical navigation between screens. The design focused on ease of use by keeping actions clear and reducing unnecessary steps, ensuring users can quickly add or edit events without confusion. This user-centered approach was successful because it prioritized efficiency and visual clarity.
Coding Approach
I developed the app in Android Studio using Kotlin. I structured the code using an activity-based model, separating user interface logic from data handling. Event data was managed through a custom adapter connected to a GridView, while intents handled navigation between activities. I focused on writing reusable functions and clean code to simplify updates or feature additions in the future.
Testing and Debugging
I tested the app using the Android Emulator, verifying that each screen loaded properly and that events could be added, displayed, and removed as expected. I also performed input validation to prevent empty fields and crashes. This testing process was important for confirming functionality and identifying logical or layout issues before finalizing the project.
Innovation and Challenges
One of the biggest challenges was managing data transfer between activities while keeping the UI responsive. I overcame this by passing event objects through intents and optimizing the GridView adapter. This improved performance and user experience without complicating the app structure.
Key Success
I was particularly successful in developing a smooth and intuitive user interface that stayed consistent across activities. This demonstrated my understanding of mobile app design principles and my ability to implement functional, user-centered applications using Kotlin and Android Studio.
